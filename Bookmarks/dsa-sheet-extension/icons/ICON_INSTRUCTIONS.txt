ICON CREATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

You need to create 3 icon files for the Chrome extension:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

DESIGN SUGGESTIONS:
1. Use a simple, clean design with DSA/coding theme
2. Colors: Use blue/purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) to match the extension theme
3. Symbol ideas:
   - A tree structure (for data structures)
   - Brackets [ ] or { } 
   - A simple flowchart or algorithm symbol
   - The letters "DSA" in a modern font
   - A combination of binary tree + search icon

TOOLS TO CREATE ICONS:
1. Online tools:
   - Canva.com
   - Figma.com
   - Icons8.com (icon generator)
   - Favicon.io

2. Desktop tools:
   - GIMP (free)
   - Photoshop
   - Paint.NET

3. Quick option:
   - Use any existing coding-related icon from free icon libraries
   - Resize to the required dimensions

PLACEHOLDER SOLUTION:
If you want to test the extension immediately, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares in any image editor
2. Save them as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
3. Place them in the icons folder

The extension will work without proper icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon.
